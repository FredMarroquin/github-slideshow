I saw a computer for the first time when I was 14 years old, a commodore 64 where I and other kids played around with games like "digger".  Sometimes I would go to the school library to get books that showed me how to code in Basic.  Though I loved the process of coding to make things many other things about being a young kid pulled me away from actually learning how to code.  I'm an old man now and I am very happy to be back to try again.
